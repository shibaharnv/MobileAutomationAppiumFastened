``` 


### PreSetp up

- Download Android studio and inside android studio set up an emulator .Update these values ipAddress=127.0.0.1 ((accessible from the same host))
  port :4723(Appium server will listen for connections)
  AndroidDeviceName=(Name of emulator in android studio)
  Android_Home=(Android sdk path)
  Java_Home=(Java home path)
  Main_Js_Path=(Appium main.js) path in /src/test/resources/data.properties


## Installation and Test Execution

- Clone the repository with below command

```
git clone  https://gitlab.com/fastned-recruitment/qa/08122023-shibahar-nagarajan

```


Open the project in any IDE Eclipse/IntelliJ.

Navigate to "fastned" folder where we have pom.xml


Run the following command in Terminal and build the project. Maven will clean the project, compile the source code, run any necessary plugins, package the artifacts, and install them into the local Maven repositoryâ€”all without executing tests.

```
$ mvn clean install -DskipTests=true
```

## Execute Tests in Local:

#### Tags explanation

```bash
  - Groups.                       -Usage
  smoke                        Smoke testing for the FastNed mobile app. Performs a series of actions such as clicking on buttons, entering text, selecting stations, and verifying station details.
  regression                   For demo purpose i have placed a testcase which will get failed after execution so that we can see the failure report
```


Run the below command where "-DRecipientList" parameter value can be updated to your email id.

Extent report path will be sent to the mentioned email id.

#### maven execution command :

```mvn test -PSmoke -DRecipientList="youremailid@domain.com"```


##  Executing testcases in CI/CD - Jenkins Integration

- Jenkins can be started by running the below command from the project directory

```java -jar jenkins.war```

- Jenkins will be started in localhost:8080 and create a free style project and configure the project and set this maven command to trigger the testcases

```test -PSmoke -DRecipientList="youremailid@domain.com"```

- Please refer screenshots for Jenkins CI/CD execution




##  Test Result Reports -Extent Reports


After executing tests, you can find the Extent Reports in the reports folder. You will see index.html that can be opened in chrome.Refer below screenshot
